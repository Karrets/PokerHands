Design and build an application that will rank a poker hand. There should be a class called Card that stores the Face and Suit of the card. The main method should have an ArrayList of Five cards that are defined in the Constructor. There should be another class called Game that has the four methods that return boolean - one for each hand.

In other words, you will be able to create a hand of five cards, and the application will determine your hand:  Full House, Flush, or Three- or Four-of-a-Kind.

 - You are not to implement the entire game of Poker (dealer, players, betting, etc.), just the hand ranking
 - You are not to compare multiple hands to determine a winner

This PDF describes hand ranks - you are only assessing four of them: [poker-hands.pdf](https://wctc.instructure.com/courses/36071/files/3972789/download?wrap=1).

The application should:

 - Include JUnit tests for all classes
 - Include Javadoc comments for all production classes and methods (not required for tests)
